# Introduction

## Problem / Question


#Materials and Methods

## Proposed methods

Packages used in this study include:
*ggplot2
*plotly
*forcast

# Data Sets
```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(rnoaa)
library(ncdf4)
library("leaflet")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
```

# NOAA buoy stations information
```{r}
x <- buoy_stations()
leaflet(data = na.omit(x)) %>%
  leaflet::addTiles() %>%
  leaflet::addCircles(~lon, ~lat, opacity = 0.5)
```

# Standard meteorological data at buoy 41052
```{r}
st_john_data <- buoy(dataset = 'stdmet', buoyid = 41052, year = 2017)
head(st_john_data)
```


# Results

## Example 1: Map of Buoy Location

```{r}
library("ggmap")
```

```{r}
"stjohn" <- c(left = 68, bottom = 18, right = 62, top = 20)%/%
  get_stamenmap(stjohn, zoom = 5)%/%
  ggmap()
```

## Severe Weather in St. John During Hurricane Season 2017

swdi(dataset='warn', startdate = '20170601', enddate = '20171101', id=41052)

## Wave Height Before During and After Hurricane

### Wave rose diagram of week before hurricanes
### Wave rose diagram of each hurricane's peak wave dates
### Wave rose diagram of week after each hurricane

# Conclusions

What have you learned?  Are there any broader implications?
