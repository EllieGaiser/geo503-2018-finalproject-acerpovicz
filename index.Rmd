# Introduction

## Problem / Question


#Materials and Methods

## Proposed methods

Packages used in this study include:
*ggplot2
*plotly
*forcast

# Data Sets
```{r, message=F, warning=F}
install.packages("rnoaa")
library(rnoaa)
install.packages("ncdf4")
library(ncdf4)
install.packages("leaflet")
library("leaflet")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
```

# NOAA buoy stations information
```{r}
x <- buoy_stations()
leaflet(data = na.omit(x)) %>%
  leaflet::addTiles() %>%
  leaflet::addCircles(~lon, ~lat, opacity = 0.5)
```

# Standard meteorological data at buoy 41052
```{r}
st_john_data <- buoy(dataset = 'stdmet', buoyid = 41052, year = 2017)
head(st_john_data)
```


# Results

## Example 1: Map of Buoy Location

```{r}
install.packages("ggmap")
library("ggmap")
```

```{r}
st_john <- c(left = 64.60, bottom = 17, right = 64.45, top = 18.30) %/%
st_john_map <- get_stamenmap(st_john, zoom = 5)%/%
ggmap(st_john_map, x= x.major, y= y.range[1])
```
